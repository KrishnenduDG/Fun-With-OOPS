## Overview üåü

This Repo contains a full-fledged CLI Mathemtical Calculator written in Python using the core concepts of `Object Oriented Programming (OOP)`.

It includes concepts like:

1. `Abstraction`
1. `Encapsulation`
1. `Class (Static) Variables`
1. `Private` Vars (Through the concept of `name-mangling` which is not truly `private`)
1. `Inheritance`

## Features üìà

It is a `Mathematical Calculator` which facilitates both `Arithmetic` and `Geometric` Operations.

`Arithmetic Operations` include:

1. `Addition`
1. `Subtraction`
1. `Multiplication`
1. `Division`
1. `Exponentiation`
1. `Factorial`

`Geometric Operations` include:

1. `Area of a Square`
1. `Area of a Rectangle`
1. `Area of a Circle`
1. `Circumference of a Circle`

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KrishnenduDG/Fun-with-OOPS.git
cd Fun-with-OOPS
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment:

```bash
python -m venv <NAME_OF_VENV>
```

3. Activate the Virtual Environment (may differ on MAC/Linux):

```bash
source <NAME_OF_VENV>/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the App:

```bash
python app.py
```
